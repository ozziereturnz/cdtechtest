Technical test for Champion Data.

Initial commits are primarily setting up empty files as I've never created a .net project using VS Code before, so I want to make sure that's all working before I write any real code. This all took about 20 minutes.

Unit test creation and implementation of Robot class took about an hour. This was mostly spent on tests as the implementation for each method is very simple.
