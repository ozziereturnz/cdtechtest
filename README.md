# cdtechtest
Technical test for Champion Data.

## Instructions
To run the app you will need to build the solution and run the Demo project (this is a command line app). The application can be run with or without a command file specified, but if one is specified you must include the full path and filename. If no file is provided then commands will be executed as input from the command line.

An example command file, complete with invalid commands, is available in ./Demo/commands.txt

## Time spent
Initial commits are primarily setting up empty files as I've never created a .net project using VS Code before, so I want to make sure that's all working before I write any real code. This all took about 20 minutes.

Unit test creation and implementation of Robot class took about an hour. This was mostly spent on tests as the implementation for each method is very simple.

Adding console commands took about 30 mins with interruptions. Adding file processing took about 15 mins.
